# Blender Eye Generator

## About
This addon is a fun project that I do to learn more about programming, I am a 3D artist but I kinda wanna try new stuff.

This Addon will helps you to create eyes in few clicks, the model is simple and it's only code based (not library link or import).

## How To Install
You can download this addon (Zip File) and then you can install it on blender 4.0+, it won;t work on blender 4.0- because they change some of the function in blender python library.
